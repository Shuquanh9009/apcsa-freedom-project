## What am I planning to do?

In this freedom project, I had chosen to learn about **Arduino** because there's a lot of useful projects I could create using Arduino.
I am looking forward to using Arduino to create a project where is about smart home security. I want to focus on smart locks
where I could better secure my items than a traditional lock. I mainly focus on using Arduino and to create a smart lock
where I could use RFID(Radio Frequency Identification), passcode, and fingerprint scanner to unlock the system. I know there's a lot
of these types of smart home security out there in the market and is **very expensive**. When creating one on my own using
Arduino is much cheaper and I could modify it to better fit my requirements.

### What are the main tools that are needed to complete this project?
1. Arduino Uno
2. RFID module
3. Finger Print module
4. Breadboard

### What am I going to do next?
As of right now, I will continue to research more about the different ways I could use Arduino to make a smart lock
system that will give high-security standards. As I research more about this project, I might change some of my original
thinkings or add new features down to create a more complex smart lock system that's different than others.

I will find all related home security projects on https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/projects

and will build on my version of the smart lock based on the standards that I want.
