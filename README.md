# APCSA Freedom Project
by Shuquan Huang 

## Context
My name is Shuquan Huang, currently a senior in the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology taking APCSA.
In APCSA, we were given a big project called **Freedom Porject**. 
Freedom Project is a yearlong project that I will be working on in the APCSA class. This project's goal is for students
to research any java or programming topics and create an awesome project throughout the year using the knowledge we
learned on our own throughout the year.
